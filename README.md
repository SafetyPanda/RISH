# RISH
RISH: Ruby Interactive Shell for Unix Systems
Please note that this is in ALPHA, if that. Due to that I would not use this as a replacement shell, yet. There will be tons of bugs and breaks. If you do use it please feel free to add your own to it and submit your changes to this repo! Or submit an issue and I will get it fixed.

# About
Replacement for BASH or ZSH. Will soon have customization, and more advanced features to seperate itself from Bash, or at least have feature parity with it.

# Features!
- Tab Completion

# Install
Clone this repo, download the zip, or download the file. As it is in Alpha I would keep your current shell and use this command `exec rish.rb` to start it.

# Commands
Open rish.rb in a text editor, will be making a man page with info later.

# Dependencies
Ruby, obviously

# In Progress
- Forking
- Customization
- More. So much more.

# Known Issues
- cd by itself will break it
- does not like paths in cd
- tab just tabs
- Lots more I'm sure
