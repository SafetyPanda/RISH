# RISH
RISH: Ruby Interactive Shell for Linux and Unix Systems Version 0.2

# About
Replacement for BASH or ZSH. Will soon have customization, and more advanced features to seperate itself from Bash, or at least have feature parity with it.
Please note that this is in **ALPHA**, if that. Due to that I would not use this as a replacement shell. If you do and it breaks something, I apologize.
If you find issues and fix them or add built in commands feel free to submit a pull request!

# Features!
- Tab Completion with built-in commands
- Some minor customization, colors and formatting words on prompt.

# Install
Clone this repo, download the zip, or download the file.

# Commands
Open rish.rb in a text editor, will be making a man page with info later.

# Usage
 As it is in Alpha I would keep your current shell and use this command `exec rish.rb` to start it.
 For debugging purposes `ruby rish.rb` so it doesn;t just close your terminal application.

# Dependencies
Ruby, obviously

# In Progress
- Customization.
- Feature parity with.
- Tab completition with all programs.
- More. So much more.

# Known Issues
- cd by itself will break shell
- Echo only outputs one word.
- Lots more I'm sure
